# Saliency maps

This is a framework to calculate the saliency maps using the Dopamine framework.
There are several branches in this project in which different calculations are made.
First, the contents of the branches are described
Then, the working of the algorithm is explained late.

Here is the description of the branches:
- master : Perturbation saliency for DQN for any game with high and low resolution
- all_saliency_maps : Full resolution perturbation saliency, gradient saliency and approximation saliency (non optimized)
- dqn_pert
